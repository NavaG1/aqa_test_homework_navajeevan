## Running Tests Locally

npx codeceptjs run --steps
##After test runs sucessfully, run below command to generate allure report.

allure serve output


At this moment, docker environment is setup.
But when we run test script using docker, run fails as puppetter is unable to launch browser.
I'm eagerly working to fix the problems and run tests via docker.



Viewing Allure Report
1. Install Allure Commandline globally:
npm install -g allure-commandline

2. Generate and open the Allure report:
allure serve output
